Superior-Digit-Recognition-Leveraging-Data-Augmentation-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Overview
This project, titled Superior Digit Recognition, focuses on enhancing the performance of digit recognition systems by leveraging data augmentation techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary objective is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high precision, utilizing a combination of CNN architectures and data augmentation strategies.

Features
Digit Recognition: Accurately recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using deep learning techniques.
Data Augmentation: Enhances model generalization by augmenting training data with transformations such as rotations, shifts, zooms, and flips.
CNN Architecture: Utilizes state-of-the-art CNN architectures to extract features and classify images effectively.
Performance Optimization: Fine-tunes hyperparameters and optimizes the model to achieve superior accuracy and performance.
